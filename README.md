# RL-based-event-triggered-MPC

This is official implementation of our paper: Event-Triggered Model Predictive Control with Off-policy Reinforcement Learning.

## Algorithms

All the rule-based/RL algorithms included in our RL-eMPC framework.
- [x] Threshold-based: TBD.
- [x] LSTDQ.
- [x] DQN.
- [x] DDQN.
- [x] DQN/DDQN + PER (prioritized experience buffer) + LSTM
- [ ] A2C (Discrete)


## Installation
- create an python virtual environment: `conda create -n rlempc python=3.8 -y`
- active the virtul environment: `conda activate rlempc`
- install pytorch (torch>=1.2.0)
